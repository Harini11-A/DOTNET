# 📅Day 1: C# Programming Basics

Welcome to Day 1 of my .NET full-stack journey.
Today’s focus was on building a strong foundation in **C# programming** — the heart of backend development with ASP.NET. 
Every great application starts with mastering the basics, and this day was all about that.

This project contains a **single console application** that combines four beginner-level programs into a menu-driven experience.
